            <h2>Candlestick Chart</h2>
            <p>A candlestick chart is a financial graph that displays price movements of a security over time. Each
                "candlestick" represents a specific time frame (e.g., a day) and shows the open, high, low, and close
                prices using rectangular "bodies" and vertical "wicks". Green or white bodies indicate a price increase,
                while red or black bodies signify a decrease, providing traders with visual insights into market
                sentiment and trends.</p>

            <h2>OHLC Bar Chart</h2>
            <p>An OHLC bar chart is a financial graph showing the open, high, low, and close prices of an asset over a
                specific time frame. Vertical lines represent the high and low, with horizontal dashes indicating the
                open (left) and close (right) prices for each period.</p>

            <h2>Heikin Ashi</h2>
            <p>Heikin Ashi charts smooth price data to filter out market noise and highlight trends. Unlike traditional
                candlesticks, each bar's open/close uses averaged data from previous bars. Green bars indicate uptrends,
                while red bars signal downtrends. Wicks are typically shorter, making it easier to visualize market
                direction and potential reversals.</p>

            <h2>Renko Chart</h2>
            <p>A Renko chart is a type of financial chart that filters out minor price movements by focusing solely on
                significant changes in price. It is constructed using "bricks" that represent a fixed price movement.
                Unlike traditional time-based charts, Renko charts do not have uniform time intervals; a new brick is
                only formed when the price moves by a predefined amount. This makes trends clearer and easier to
                identify.</p>

            <h2>Range Chart</h2>
            <p>A range chart
                displays the variability of data by plotting both the minimum and maximum values for each category or
                time point. It uses two values per data point (a high and a low) to represent the difference, often
                filling the area between them to emphasize the span of the range. This visualization effectively
                highlights data distribution and extreme values.</p>

            <h2>Point and Figure</h2>
            <p>A Point and Figure (P&F) chart is a technical analysis tool that filters out minor price movements to
                reveal significant trends. It uses columns of 'X's to denote rising prices and 'O's for falling prices,
                with only material price changes recorded. This creates a visually simple chart emphasizing supply and
                demand dynamics and trend reversals rather than time.</p>
