    <h1>Chasing the Market</h1>
    <p>
        “Chasing the market” refers to entering trades impulsively after a strong price move, often out of fear of
        missing out (FOMO). While it may feel exciting in the moment, this behavior can lead to poor entries, increased
        risk, and emotional decision-making.

    <h2>Why Traders Chase the Market</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>FOMO:</strong> Fear of missing a big move or breakout</li>
        <li><strong>Overconfidence:</strong> Believing the trend will continue indefinitely</li>
        <li><strong>Lack of a plan:</strong> Trading without predefined entry criteria</li>
        <li><strong>Emotional triggers:</strong> Reacting to news, social media, or other traders</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Risks of Chasing the Market</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Entering at or near the top of a move</li>
        <li>Increased slippage and poor risk/reward ratios</li>
        <li>Emotional trading and lack of discipline</li>
        <li>Higher likelihood of stop-outs and drawdowns</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Avoid Chasing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a trading plan with clear entry and exit rules</li>
        <li>Wait for pullbacks or confirmation before entering</li>
        <li>Set alerts instead of watching price obsessively</li>
        <li>Journal your trades and emotions to identify patterns</li>
        <li>Focus on process over outcome—don’t force trades</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Helpful Tools</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Trading journals (e.g., EdgeWonk, TraderSync)</li>
        <li>Charting platforms with alert systems</li>
        <li>Risk calculators to assess trade quality</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Chasing the market is a common mistake, especially for new traders. By staying patient, following your plan, and
        focusing on high-quality setups, you can avoid emotional traps and trade with greater consistency.
