    <h1>Getting Started as a Retail Currency Trader</h1>
    <p>Retail currency trading—also known as forex trading—is the practice of buying and selling currencies to
        profit from fluctuations in exchange rates. Unlike institutional traders who work for banks or hedge
        funds,
        retail traders operate independently, typically using online platforms from home. With over $7 trillion
        traded daily, the forex market offers vast opportunities—but also significant risks.</p>

            <h1>🧭 Step 1: Learn the Basics</h1>
            <p>Before placing your first trade, it's essential to understand how the forex market works. Currencies are
                traded in pairs (e.g., EUR/USD), and their values fluctuate based on interest rates, inflation, economic
                data, and geopolitical events. You’ll need to grasp key concepts like pips, lots, leverage, and margin.
                Free
                resources like IG Academy, Investopedia, and broker webinars are excellent starting points.

            <h1>🏦 Step 2: Choose a Broker and Platform</h1>
            <div style="line-height: 1.7em;">
                Select a reputable forex broker that offers competitive spreads, strong regulation, and a user-friendly
                trading platform. Popular platforms include MetaTrader 4, MetaTrader 5, and NinjaTrader. Many brokers
                offer
                demo accounts—practice environments where you can trade with virtual money to build confidence and test
                strategies.

            <h1>📊 Step 3: Develop a Trading Strategy</h1>
            <p>
                Successful traders don’t rely on luck. They use technical analysis (charts, indicators) or fundamental
                analysis (economic news) to guide decisions. Choose a trading style that suits your
                personality—scalping,
                day trading, swing trading, or position trading—and stick to a consistent plan.

            </p>
            <h1>⚖️ Step 4: Manage Risk</h1>
            <p>
                Risk management is the cornerstone of long-term success. Use stop-loss orders to cap potential losses,
                limit
                leverage to avoid overexposure, and never risk more than 1–2% of your account on a single trade. Keep a
                trading journal to track performance and refine your approach.
            </p>
