    <h2>What Is Forex Trading?</h2>
    <p>Forex (foreign exchange) trading involves buying and selling currencies to profit from changes in exchange rates.
        It’s the largest financial market in the world, with over $7 trillion traded daily.</p>

    <h2>Major Concepts to Understand</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Currency Pairs:</strong> Currencies are traded in pairs like EUR/USD or GBP/JPY. The first currency
            is the base, the second is the quote.</li>
        <li><strong>Bid/Ask Spread:</strong> The difference between the buying (bid) and selling (ask) price. Tight
            spreads are better for traders.</li>
        <li><strong>Leverage:</strong> Allows traders to control large positions with small capital. Common ratios are
            50:1 or 100:1, but leverage increases risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Market Hours:</strong> The forex market operates 24 hours a day, five days a week, across global
            financial centers.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Analysis:</strong> Uses charts and indicators to predict price movements. Popular tools
            include RSI, MACD, and moving averages.</li>
        <li><strong>Fundamental Analysis:</strong> Focuses on economic data, interest rates, and geopolitical events to
            assess currency strength.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Includes stop-loss orders, position sizing, and avoiding over-leverage to
            protect capital.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>To begin trading forex, choose a regulated broker, open a demo account, and study both technical and fundamental
        strategies. Practice discipline and always manage your risk.</p>
