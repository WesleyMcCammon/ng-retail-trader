    <h1>Currency Traders and the Forex Market</h1>
        <p>
            Retail currency traders are individuals who participate in the foreign exchange (forex) market to profit
            from fluctuations in currency values. Unlike institutional traders working for banks or hedge funds, retail
            traders operate independently, often using online platforms from home or small offices. Their goal is to buy
            low and sell high—or vice versa—based on short-term price movements.

        <h1>💱 How Retail Traders Operate</h1>
        <p>Retail traders access the forex market through brokers that offer trading platforms like MetaTrader,
            NinjaTrader, or cTrader. They trade currency pairs such as EUR/USD, GBP/JPY, or AUD/CAD. These pairs
            represent the value of one currency relative to another. Traders use technical analysis (charts, indicators,
            price patterns) and fundamental analysis (economic news, interest rates, geopolitical events) to make
            informed decisions.
            Most retail trades are speculative and short-term, ranging from minutes to days. Leverage—borrowing capital
            to increase position size—is commonly used, but it amplifies both gains and losses.
        </p>
        <h1>⚖️ Risk Management Strategies</h1>
        <div style="line-height: 1.7em;">
            Risk management is crucial in forex trading. Retail traders use:
            <ul>
                <li>Stop-loss orders to automatically exit losing trades</li>
                <li>Position sizing to control exposure</li>
                <li>Risk/reward ratios to evaluate trade viability</li>
                <li>Avoiding over-leverage to prevent catastrophic losses</li>
            </ul>

            Successful traders follow strict discipline, maintain trading journals, and continuously refine their
            strategies.

        <h1>📚 Forex Market Basics</h1>
        <p>
            The forex market is the largest and most liquid financial market in the world, with over $7 trillion traded
            daily. It operates 24 hours a day, five days a week, across major financial centers like London, New York,
            Tokyo, and Sydney. Unlike stock markets, forex is decentralized—trades occur over-the-counter (OTC) via a
            global network of banks, brokers, and institutions.
            Major participants include central banks, commercial banks, corporations, hedge funds, and retail traders.
            Currency values are influenced by interest rates, inflation, employment data, and geopolitical stability.
