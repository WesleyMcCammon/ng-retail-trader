            <h3><img src="/assets/images/retailTrader.png" alt="Example Image" class="inline-image">  What Is a Retail Trader?</h3>
            <p>A retail trader is an individual investor who buys and sells financial instruments using their own personal funds. Unlike institutional traders who manage large pools of capital for organizations, retail traders operate independently, often through online brokerage platforms. They participate in markets such as stocks, forex, cryptocurrencies, and commodities, typically trading smaller volumes. Retail traders may be full-time professionals, part-time enthusiasts, or beginners seeking to grow their wealth. With the rise of mobile apps and educational resources, retail trading has become more accessible. These traders rely on research, technical analysis, and market news to make informed decisions and manage risk.</p>

            <p>The stock market, forex, and futures trading are distinct financial arenas. The <strong>stock market</strong> involves buying and selling shares of publicly traded companies, offering ownership and dividends. <strong>Forex trading</strong> focuses on currency pairs, where traders speculate on exchange rate fluctuations between global currencies like EUR/USD. It’s the largest and most liquid market. <strong>Futures trading</strong> involves contracts to buy or sell assets (like commodities or indexes) at a predetermined price and date. Unlike stocks, futures are leveraged and often used for hedging or speculation. Each market has unique risks, strategies, and trading hours, catering to different trader goals and styles.</p>

            <h3><img src="/assets/images/technicalAnalysisIcon.png" alt="Example Image" class="inline-image"> Intro to Technical Analysis</h3>
            <p>Retail trading technical analysis involves evaluating price charts and market data to forecast future price movements. Retail traders use tools like candlestick patterns, moving averages, RSI, MACD, and support/resistance levels to identify entry and exit points. Unlike fundamental analysis, which focuses on company performance, technical analysis relies on historical price behavior and volume trends. It’s popular among retail traders due to its visual nature and adaptability across asset classes like stocks, forex, and crypto. Many traders combine multiple indicators to refine their strategies, aiming to capitalize on short-term price fluctuations while managing risk through stop-loss and position sizing techniques.</p>

            <h3><img src="/assets/images/fundamentalAnalysisIcon.png" alt="Example Image" class="inline-image"> Fundamental Analysis Basics</h3>
            <p>Retail trading fundamental analysis involves evaluating a company’s financial health, industry position, and macroeconomic factors to determine its intrinsic value. Retail traders examine financial statements, earnings reports, revenue growth, debt levels, and management performance. They also consider external influences like interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical events. Unlike technical analysis, which focuses on price patterns, fundamental analysis aims to identify undervalued or overvalued assets based on real-world data. Retail traders use this approach to make long-term investment decisions, often seeking stable companies with strong fundamentals. It’s a key strategy for building portfolios focused on growth, income, or value investing.</p>
