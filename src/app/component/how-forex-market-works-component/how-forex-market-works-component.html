        <h2>How the Forex Market Works</h2>
        <p>The foreign exchange (forex) market is a global decentralized marketplace where currencies are traded. It
            operates 24 hours a day, five days a week, and is the largest financial market in the world by trading
            volume. Forex trading involves buying one currency while simultaneously selling another, which is why
            currencies are quoted in pairs—such as EUR/USD or GBP/JPY. The first currency in the pair is the base
            currency, and the second is the quote currency. Traders speculate on the price movement of these pairs,
            aiming to profit from changes in exchange rates. Prices fluctuate due to various factors including interest
            rates, inflation, political stability, and economic performance. The market is driven by supply and demand,
            and participants range from central banks and financial institutions to retail traders. Most trading occurs
            over-the-counter (OTC), meaning transactions are conducted electronically between parties rather than
            through a centralized exchange. Leverage is commonly used in forex, allowing traders to control larger
            positions with a smaller amount of capital, though this also increases risk. Forex brokers provide platforms
            for trading and typically earn through spreads—the difference between the bid and ask price. Successful
            forex trading requires understanding market fundamentals, technical analysis, and risk management strategies
            to navigate its volatility.
