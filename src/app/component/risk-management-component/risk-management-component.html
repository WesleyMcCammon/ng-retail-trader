    <h2>1. Understand Leverage and Margin</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Leverage amplifies both gains and losses—use it cautiously.</li>
        <li>Know your broker’s margin requirements and how they affect position sizing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Use Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Orders</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Set stop-loss levels before entering any trade to cap potential losses.</li>
        <li>Use take-profit targets to lock in gains and avoid emotional exits.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Limit Risk Per Trade</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Risk no more than 1–2% of your account balance per trade.</li>
        <li>Calculate position size based on stop-loss distance and account size.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Diversify Your Exposure</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Avoid concentrating risk in a single currency pair or futures contract.</li>
        <li>Use uncorrelated assets to reduce systemic risk.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Monitor Volatility</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use indicators like ATR to gauge market volatility and adjust stops accordingly.</li>
        <li>Be cautious during news events and low-liquidity periods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Maintain a Risk Journal</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Track your trades, risk levels, and emotional decisions.</li>
        <li>Review performance regularly to refine your strategy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Use Risk Calculators and Tools</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Leverage online calculators for position sizing and margin impact.</li>
        <li>Consider platforms like TraderSync, TradesViz, or Trademetria for integrated risk tracking.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Risk management isn’t just about avoiding losses—it’s about staying in the game long enough to let your edge
        play out. With discipline and structure, retail traders can thrive in leveraged markets like futures and forex.
