    <p>
        Technical analysis is the study of price action, volume, and chart patterns to forecast future market movements.

        psychology.

        <li><strong>Price Discounts Everything:</strong> All known information is reflected in the current price.</li>
        <li><strong>Prices Move in Trends:</strong> Markets tend to move in identifiable trends until they reverse.</li>
        <li><strong>History Repeats Itself:</strong> Patterns and behaviors often recur due to human psychology.</li>
