    <h2>1. Trading Without a Plan</h2>
    <p>
        Creating a trade plan is essential for consistent, disciplined trading. It defines your strategy, risk tolerance, entry and exit rules, and helps eliminate emotional decision-making. Without a plan, traders often react impulsively to market movements, leading to losses and frustration. A well-structured plan keeps you focused, minimizes guesswork, and allows for performance tracking and improvement. It also helps manage risk by setting clear stop-loss and profit targets. Whether you're a beginner or experienced trader, a trade plan acts as your roadmap—keeping you grounded during volatility and ensuring your actions align with long-term goals rather than short-term emotions.

    <h2>2. Risking Too Much Capital</h2>
    <p>
        Risking too much capital in a single trade can quickly lead to devastating losses, especially in volatile markets. Without proper risk management, one bad trade can wipe out a significant portion of your account, making recovery difficult. Overexposure increases emotional stress, leading to impulsive decisions and poor judgment. It also undermines consistency, which is key to long-term success. Smart traders limit risk to a small percentage of their capital—typically 1–2% per trade—to preserve their account and stay in the game. By managing risk wisely, you protect your capital, reduce anxiety, and maintain the discipline needed for sustainable trading.

    <h2>3. Overtrading</h2>
    <p>
        Overtrading can quickly erode your capital and emotional discipline. When traders place too many trades, often driven by excitement, boredom, or fear of missing out, they increase exposure to risk and transaction costs. This behavior leads to impulsive decisions, poor trade setups, and burnout. Overtrading also makes it harder to evaluate performance and refine strategies, as results become clouded by noise. Successful trading requires patience, selectivity, and focus on high-quality opportunities. By limiting trades to those that meet your criteria, you preserve capital, reduce stress, and maintain a clear, consistent approach that supports long-term growth and learning.

    <h2>4. Ignoring Risk Management</h2>
    <p>
        Ignoring risk management is one of the most dangerous mistakes a trader can make. Without clear rules for limiting losses, a single bad trade can wipe out a large portion of your capital. Many new traders focus solely on potential profits, overlooking the importance of protecting their downside. This leads to emotional decisions, overexposure, and inconsistent results. Risk management tools like stop-loss orders, position sizing, and risk-reward ratios are essential for long-term success. By defining how much you're willing to lose before entering a trade, you maintain control, reduce stress, and build a disciplined approach that supports sustainable growth and learning.

    <h2>5. Chasing the Market</h2>
    <p>
        Chasing the market refers to entering trades impulsively after a strong price move, often driven by fear of missing out (FOMO). Traders who chase typically buy high or sell low, hoping to catch momentum, but often enter too late and face reversals. This reactive behavior undermines discipline and leads to poor risk-reward setups. Without a planned entry, traders may ignore technical signals and overexpose their capital. Chasing also increases emotional stress and inconsistency. Successful trading requires patience and strategy—waiting for setups that align with your plan. Avoiding the urge to chase helps preserve capital and supports long-term growth.
